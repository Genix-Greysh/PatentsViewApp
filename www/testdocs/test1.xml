Ser. No. 11/204,691, filed on Aug. 16, 2005, entitled &#x201c;A SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR REMOVING PARTICLES IN SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING,&#x201d; the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p> <heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading> <p id="p-0003" num="0002">During the manufacturing of semiconductor devices, unwanted particles are often deposited on wafers from known or unknown sources. Such deposition may occur on various layers of a wafer, such as the substrate, photoresist layer, photo mask layer, and/or other layers of the wafer. As the dimensions of wafers continue to decrease, the presence of even a few particles may adversely affect the quality of the semiconductor device and result in the reduction of yield. For example, due to the presence of one or more particles on the surface of a wafer, an etching process may result in an undesired uneven surface.</p> <p id="p-0004" num="0003">Accordingly, manufacturers strive to remove undesirable particles from wafers. However, previously available art is focused on passively detecting defects caused by the presence of particles. Frequently, manufacturers simply impose such responsibilities upon the operators, who are already burdened with the ordinary operational tasks. Since the probability of particle deposition on the wafers is random, it is challenging to identify the root cause of the deposition and means for eliminating them. As a result, semiconductor devices have to been discarded due to defects caused by the presence of particles that should have been removed.</p> <?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="tail"?> <?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?> <description-of-drawings> <heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading> <p id="p-0005" num="0004">Aspects of the present disclosure are best understood from the following detailed description when read with the accompanying figures.

Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are, of course, merely examples and are not intended to be limiting.</p> <p id="p-0010" num="0009">The improved method for proactively removing particles from semiconductor wafers introduces an apparatus with electrostatic and/or electromagnetic capability to attract and remove the particles form the wafer during the process of scanning the wafer. The apparatus may be installed at various locations and performed multiple times during the manufacturing process. In one example, the apparatus may be a stand-alone unit or an integrated unit that is installed at the entrance of a process chamber. As a result, whenever the wafer is transferred into or from the chamber, the apparatus may be used to scan the wafer and remove unwanted particles from the wafer.</p> <p id="p-0011" num="0010">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an exemplary method <b>10</b> for removing particles in semiconductor manufacturing is shown. In this embodiment, method <b>10</b> initiates with step <b>12</b>, which provides a wafer or otherwise conveys a wafer to the apparatus. The wafer may include a substrate, a dielectric layer, a bottom anti-reflective coating (BARC) layer, and a photoresist layer, for example. The substrate may include one or more insulator, conductor, and/or semiconductor layers. For example, the substrate may include an elementary semiconductor, such as crystal silicon, polycrystalline silicon, amorphous silicon, and/or germanium; a compound semiconductor, such as silicon carbide and/or gallium arsenic; an alloy semiconductor, such as SiGe, GaAsP, AlInAs, AlGaAs, and/or GaInP. Further, the substrate may include a bulk semiconductor, such as bulk silicon, and such a bulk semiconductor may include an epi silicon layer. It may also or alternatively include a semiconductor-on-insulator substrate, such as a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate, or a thin-film transistor (TFT) substrate. The substrate may also or alternatively include a multiple silicon structure or a multilayer compound semiconductor structure. The dielectric layer may be formed by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), plasma-enhanced CVD (PECVD), physical vapor deposition (PVD), atomic layer deposition (ALD), spin-on coating and/or other processes. The dielectric layer may be an inter-metal dielectric (IMD), and may include low-k materials, silicon dioxide, polyimide, spin-on-glass (SOG), fluoride-doped silicate glass (FSG), Black Diamond&#xae; (a product of Applied Materials of Santa Clara, Calif.), Xerogel, Aerogel, amorphous fluorinated carbon, and/or other materials. The BARC layer may be deposited over the dielectric layer by a variety of techniques, including but not limited to spin-on coating, PVD, CVD, and/or other processes. The photoresist layer may be formed by spin-on coating and/or other processes. In operation, a photoresist solution is dispensed onto the surface of the BARC layer, and the wafer is spun rapidly until the photoresist solution is almost dry, and then baked to harden the material.</p> <p id="p-0012" num="0011">The wafer may be transferred to an etching chamber (not shown) for etching purposes. The etching chamber may include particles, which may be deposited over the wafer. For example, a ferromagnetic material such as iron, nickel, cobalt, gadolinium, dysprosium, rare earth material; an insulator, such as polyester plastics, hair, wool fabrics, Teflon; and/or other materials, may be deposited over the wafer. In one example, the particles may included organic materials, such as organic O and/or organic C; inorganic materials, such as inorganic Si, inorganic S, inorganic CI, and/or inorganic B; metal, such as Fe, Al, Cu, Zn, Na; and/or other materials.</p> <p id="p-0013" num="0012">During the fabrication process and between the formation or processing of any material layers on the substrate, the particle removal process may be carried out. In step <b>14</b>, a first group of particles is removed from the wafer by a first device using electrostatic methodology. In step <b>14</b>, the wafer is put in the presence of a static electric field, which attracts particles on the surface of the wafer that are net positively charged. Further, the unwanted particles may include an insulator, such as polyester plastics, hair, wool fabrics, Teflon, and/or other materials. This type of particles may be attracted and removed using the electrostatic methodology.</p> <p id="p-0014" num="0013">In step <b>16</b>, a second group of particles is removed from the wafer by an electromagnetic methodology. In this step, the wafer is put in the presence of an electromagnetic field, which attracts and removes particles that are magnetic or become magnetic during the fabrication process. These particle(s) may include a ferromagnetic metal (such as iron, nickel, cobalt, gadolinium, or dysprosium), which may exhibit magnetic behavior. A second device (i.e. second to the first device described in association with the electrostatic methodology) may be used to generate the electromagnetic field described in this step. As a result, the second device may attract and remove the particles from the wafer. The second device may be any electromagnetic device known in the art. It should be noted that steps <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> may be inter-changed in sequence, and either step may be optionally omitted at one or more occasions during the manufacturing process.</p> <p id="p-0015" num="0014">The method <b>10</b> may be utilized in the manufacturing of a variety of semiconductor devices (with or without the damascene technology), such as memory devices (including but not limited to a static random access memory (SRAM)), logic devices (including but not limited to a metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET)), and/or other devices. The method <b>10</b> may be applied to either dry lithography or wet lithography.</p> <p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is contemplated that the first and second devices may be integrated into a single device or may be stand-alone devices positioned at various points in the semiconductor processing path. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a simplified block diagram of an embodiment of an integrated device <b>20</b> that incorporates an electrostatic device <b>22</b> and an electromagnetic device <b>24</b> to remove unwanted particles of various types. Electrostatic device <b>22</b> is operable to remove electrostatically-charged particles from the wafers <b>26</b> to yield clean wafers <b>28</b>. Electromagnetic device <b>24</b> is operable to remove magnetic particles from the wafers <b>26</b>. Alternatively, the first and/or second devices <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> may be integrated into existing equipment in the semiconductor manufacturing facility. In one example, the devices (integrated or not) may be installed at the entrance of a processing chamber, so that it may be used to scan the wafer and remove particles therefrom prior to or after processing. In a second example, the device may be used prior to or following one or more manufacturing steps, such as exposure, development, etching, and/or other steps.</p> <p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a simplified schematic diagram of an exemplary embodiment of a first device <b>30</b> that uses electrostatic electricity to remove unwanted particles. Device <b>30</b> comprises a processing chamber with a nozzle <b>31</b> equipped with an inlet <b>32</b> and an outlet <b>34</b>. Inlet <b>32</b> is coupled to a purge gas source (not shown). The purge gas may comprise electrostatically-charged gas molecules or ions <b>36</b>, for example positively-charged gas molecules or ions as shown. Examples of purge gases include compressed dry air (CDA), nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>), carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), and argon (Ar). Outlet <b>34</b> is coupled to a low pressure sink, such as a vacuum pump device (not shown). The wafer <b>38</b> is coupled to a source of positive charges so that the wafer as well as unwanted particles <b>40</b> resting thereon become positively charged. Further, the inner walls of outlet <b>34</b> may be coupled to a source of the opposite charge, i.e. negative charges. As nozzle <b>31</b> passes over the surface of the wafer (or as the wafer passes under the nozzle), gas molecules or ions <b>36</b> that are similarly charged as the wafer is injected via inlet <b>32</b>. Because the charged particles are oppositely-charged from the outlet and because of the flow of purge gas from the inlet to the outlet, the particles become attracted toward the outlet and are eventually evacuated.</p> <p id="p-0018" num="0017">It should be noted that many variations of the above embodiments are contemplated herein. In one example, the particles may be composed of a single material or it may be a combination of two or more materials. The first and second devices may be constructed as separate units or as an integrated unit, and that they may be installed at identical or different locations of the manufacturing facility.</p> <p id="p-0019" num="0018">Although only a few exemplary embodiments of this disclosure have been described in details above, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that many modifications are possible in the exemplary embodiments without materially departing from the novel teachings and advantages of this disclosure. Also, features illustrated and discussed above with respect to some embodiments can be combined with features illustrated and discussed above with respect to other embodiments.
